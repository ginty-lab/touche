touch√©
=============
This repository houses the tools we use to explore the sense of touch.  These fall into a couple categories:  

::  touch stimulator control -- everything concerned with controlling our touch stimulus hardware ::


::  stimulator tracking -- code for parsing of stage position triggers into physical coordinates and converting signals into meaningful quantities ::

stgtracker.py


::  reconstruction of patterned stimuli -- deals with neural signals as a function of touch stimuli, parsing the spatial pattern of activity (grid, stroke, etc.) from individual trials  ::
