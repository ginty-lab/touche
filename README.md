touch√©
=============
This repository houses the tools we use to explore the sense of touch.  These fall into a couple categories:  

::  touch stimulator control  ::

::  parsing of stage position triggers into physical coordinates, and code for interpreting hardware trigger signals ::

::  reconstruction of patterned stimuli (grid, stroke, etc.) from individual trials  ::
